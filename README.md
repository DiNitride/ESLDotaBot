# ESLDotaBot
A Discord bot to manage roles on the Official ESL Dota 2 Server

## No longer maintained

Please do not try to host this bot. It was written in the legacy (async) (actually the current version, but will be replaced with rewrite when it is finished) version of the discord.py library, and is written specifically for the ESL Dota 2 Server. It will serve no purpose to any other.

That said, if you are working in the async version, feel free to use it as reference material.

**Build by DiNitride for ESL Dota 2 Community Manager - MenOfWar#3817**
